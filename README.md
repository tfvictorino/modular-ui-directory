#Modular User Interface Directory

##About
This directory is a set of references on new perspectives and approaches for building user interfaces and design systems. It covers the motivations behind this mindset, as well as ways to achieving it on design and front-end workflows. You'll find several articles, tools, methodologies and techniques written by awesome people from the Web community. I hope that they inspire you as they inspired me.
